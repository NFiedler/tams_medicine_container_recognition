# TAMS Medicine Container Recognition

This is a module designed to detect orange medicine containers on a table based on a pointcloud generated by a RGBD camera. It is based on the [tams_bartender_recognition](https://github.com/TAMS-Group/tams_bartender_recognition) but does not use a ransac algorithm and neural net classifier.
